## 1. Introduction

This platform is built to streamline user interactions with AI tools and prompts. Whether you're a content creator, developer, or an AI enthusiast, our platform provides a suite of AI-driven functionalities, making it easy to generate content, automate workflows, and explore innovative prompts.

Powered by Gemini AI, the platform provides a user-friendly interface for both casual and premium users.

## 2. User Roles and Authentication

### User Types

- **Guest Users**: Users who visit the platform without signing in can browse the homepage and view general features but cannot interact with AI prompts or tools.
- **Authenticated Users**: Users who sign up and log in using Clerk authentication will have access to the full set of features, including AI prompts and tools, as long as they have credits.

### Authentication Flow

- **Sign-up and Login**: New users must create an account through Clerk. Existing users can log in.
- **Session Management**: Once logged in, users will stay authenticated as long as their session is valid. Sessions will automatically expire after a period of inactivity for security purposes.

## 3. Credits System Overview

Our platform uses a credit-based system to regulate access to AI tools and prompts. Each time a user interacts with an AI tool (e.g., generating a prompt or using a feature), credits are deducted from their account.

### How the Credit System Works

- **Initial Credits**: Every authenticated user is provided a set number of credits upon account creation.
- **Credit Deduction**: Credits are deducted when a user accesses AI tools or features.
- **Credit Depletion**: When credits reach zero, the user will be restricted from using certain tools. They will be prompted to upgrade to a premium plan or purchase more credits.
- **Top-up Credits**: Users can purchase additional credits through the app‚Äôs in-built purchase system.

## 4. Premium Features and Plans

If a user runs out of credits, they can either wait for daily credit refresh (if applicable) or upgrade to premium plans. Premium users benefit from:

- **Unlimited Credits**: Premium users will not have credit restrictions.
- **Exclusive Tools**: Certain high-level AI prompts and tools are only available to premium users.
- **Priority Access**: Premium users get faster response times from the AI-powered features.

### Available Plans

- **Basic Plan**: Limited credits, access to core tools.
- **Premium Plan**: Unlimited credits, exclusive access to all tools.
- **Custom Plan**: Tailored for business needs, with added features like team collaboration, advanced API access, and more.
